## v1.2.0 - Visual Overhaul & Parchment Theme
- **Feature:** Requires Foundry V12+ (verified for V13).
- **Design:** Complete visual overhaul to match the "Parchment" aesthetic of other modules.
- **Fix:** Resolved visibility issues in Dark Mode by enforcing a fixed parchment background and high-contrast text.
- **Fix:** Window background now uses the core Foundry parchment texture (`ui/parchment.jpg`) for a native look.
